What is PyForbes?
#############

PyForbes is an unofficial Python wrapper for Forbes API intended for developers 
and data scientists to help fetch the data from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/). 
This package is created independently and is not associated with Forbes.

PyForbes currently supports fetching data for 61 Forbes Lists. 

Additionally, PyForbes provides pythonic interface to get the data as DataFrame 
or JSON Dict to eliminate the overhead time to convert the API response to 
appropriate data format for analyzing and building applications.
