Filing Bug Reports
==================

If you find a bug, an issue where the product doesn't behave as you
expect, you may file a bug report at `the project page
<https://github.com/laxmena/PyForbes/issues>`_. Be sure to include
what your expectation was, what happened instead, details about
your system that might be relevant, and steps that someone else
could take to replicate your finding. The more detailed and exact
your description, the better one of the volunteers on the project may
be able to help resolve your issue.

Fixing Bugs
===========

PyForbes might have open, reported `issues
<https://github.com/laxmena/PyForbes/issues>`_. Feel free to find 
one that you think you can solve or introduce yourself and ask for 
guidance to the previous contributors.

As you work through the issue and commit changes to your clone
of the repository, be sure to add issue references to your changes
(like "Fixes #999" or "Ref #999") so your changes link to the
issue and vice-versa.
